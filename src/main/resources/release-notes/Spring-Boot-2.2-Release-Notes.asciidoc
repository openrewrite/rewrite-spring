= Spring Boot 2.2 Release Notes



== Upgrading from Spring Boot 2.1



=== Deprecations from Spring Boot 2.1
Classes, methods and properties that were deprecated in Spring Boot 2.1 have been removed in this release.
Please ensure that you aren't calling deprecated methods before upgrading.



=== Spring Framework 5.2
This release upgrades to Spring Framework 5.2.
Please refer to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-5.x#upgrading-to-version-52[Spring Framework's upgrade documentation] for further details.



=== JMX now disabled by default
As of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/16090[#16090], JMX is not enabled by default anymore. This feature can be enabled with the configuration property `spring.jmx.enabled=true`.
If you're using IDE features to administer your applications, you may want to enable that flag there as well.


=== Fork enabled by default in Maven Plugin
Spring Boot applications that are ran by the Maven plugin are now forked by default. If you were customizing properties using `-D`, these are no longer passed to the Spring Boot application. Such properties can be specified using `-Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments` and dedicated options exist, such as for enabling a profile. Refer to {maven-docs}[the reference documentation] for more details.


=== Jakarta EE dependencies
Where possible, we have moved from Java EE dependencies with a `javax.*` group ID to the equivalent Jakarta EE dependencies with a `jakarta.*` group ID in Spring Boot's starters.
Dependency management for the Jakarta EE API dependencies has been added alongside the existing dependency management for the Java EE API dependencies.
The dependency management for the Java EE API dependencies will be removed in the future and all users are encouraged to move to the Jakarta EE API dependencies.

As part of the Java EE to Jakarta EE migration, two dependencies have changed artifact ID in their latest maintenance releases.
`com.sun.mail:javax.mail` is now `com.sun.mail:jakarta.mail` and `org.glassfish:javax.el` is now `org.glassfish:jakarta.el`.
In the unlikely event that you were using either of these dependencies directly, please update your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` accordingly.



=== JUnit 5
`spring-boot-starter-test` now provides JUnit 5 by default.
JUnit 5's vintage engine is included by default to support existing JUnit 4-based test classes so that you can migrate to JUnit 5 when you are ready to do so.
It is also possible to use a mixture of JUnit 4- and JUnit 5-based test classes in the same module.
This allows you to migrate to JUnit 5 gradually if you wish.

Note that the Maven Surefire plugin for JUnit 4 does not support the `listener` property.
If you have a Maven configuration similar to the following:

[source, xml]
----
<configuration>
	<properties>
		<property>
			<name>listener</name>
			<value>com.example.CustomRunListener</value>
		</property>
	</properties>
</configuration>
----

You can't use the `junit-vintage-engine` and you'll need to explicitly roll back to JUnit 4:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
		<exclusions>
			<exclusion>
				<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
				<artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
			</exclusion>
			<exclusion>
				<groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
				<artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
			</exclusion>
			<exclusion>
				<groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
				<artifactId>mockito-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
			</exclusion>
		</exclusions>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>junit</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
		<version>4.12</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----



=== AssertJ 3.12
This release upgrades to AssertJ 3.12 that contains a breaking API change for assertions related to `Iterator`.
Please see the https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-3-12-0-release-notes[AssertJ release notes] for details.



=== Devtools configuration no longer considered in integration tests
Devtools configuration specified in your home directory is no longer considered in integration tests.



=== Spring HATEOAS 1.0
This release upgrades to Spring HATEOAS 1.0 which contains some breaking API changes. Please see the https://spring.io/blog/2019/03/05/spring-hateoas-1-0-m1-released#overhaul[blog post that announced the M1 release] for details and a script that can be used to ease the migration.



=== DataSize migration for logging.file size-based properties
`logging.file.max-size` and `logging.file.total-size-cap` are now using the standard `DataSize` type in replacement of the proprietary `FileSize` type.
If you are using any of those properties, make sure to {docs}/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-conversion-datasize[align to the standard format].



=== DataSource health
The `DataSource` health indicator contains an extra `validationQuery` attribute with the validation query that was used against the `DataSource`.
Also, the result of the query that used to be provided by the `hello` attribute has been renamed to `result`.



=== Elasticsearch
This release upgrades to Elasticsearch 6.7 which contains some breaking API changes.
Please see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/breaking-changes-6.5.html[6.5], https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/breaking-changes-6.6.html[6.6] and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/breaking-changes-6.7.html[6.7] breaking changes pages for details.

Both the Elasticsearch transport and Jest clients have been deprecated in favor of other options, such as `RestHighLevelClient`.
The {docs}/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-elasticsearch[reference docs on Elasticsearch support] have been updated.



=== Hibernate Dialect
Spring Boot now lets Hibernate chose the dialect to use rather than applying a default dialect based on the detected database. If you are interested by this feature, please make sure you don't specify the database platform explicitly (i.e. via `spring.jpa.database` or `spring.jpa.database-platform`).

If you had a dialect configured previously, you may want to remove your customization.



=== Actuator HTTP Trace and Auditing are disabled by default
The Actuator HTTP Trace and Auditing features are not enabled by default anymore, since the default repositories implementations are in-memory and may consume too many resources and are not cluster friendly
For robust, production-grade HTTP tracing we recommend the use of https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth[Spring Cloud Sleuth] or similar.

To enable HTTP tracing, contribute a bean implementing `HttpTraceRepository` or `AuditEventRepository` to turn those features back on.
Configuration properties are available to turn those features off even in the presence of those beans (see `management.auditevents.enabled` and `management.trace.http.enabled`)



=== Gradle requirements
The minimum requirements for Gradle have changed - Spring Boot now requires Gradle 4.10+.
Please upgrade accordingly.



=== Jetty logging configuration
`server.jetty.accesslog.*` configuration properties related to log formatting are no longer available (the ones related to log files are still there).

If your application is making use of those properties, two new keys have been introduced, `format` and `custom-format`; `format` allows you to choose amongst existing formats, `custom-format` allows you to use your own format:

[source, properties]
----
server.jetty.accesslog.format=NCSA # enum with predefined formats: NCSA, EXTENDED_NCSA
server.jetty.accesslog.custom-format= # String, custom format overriding the former if defined
----

Unsupported options now translate to defining a custom log format and using options as defined in Jetty's https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/CustomRequestLog.java[CustomRequestLog].



=== Hamcrest 2.1
This release upgrades to Hamcrest 2.1. This should be a drop-in replacement for most users.
If you have a direct dependency on `org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core` or `org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library`, please use the new combined module, `org.hamcrest:hamcrest`, instead.
If you depend on Hamcrest via `spring-boot-starter-test` no action is required.



=== Freemarker templates configuration
This release changes the default template file extension for Freemarker templates.
This aligns Spring Boot with safe configuration defaults for web applications.
Please rename existing templates from `+*.ftl+` to `*.ftlh` when upgrading.



=== Tomcat's MBean Registry
Tomcat's MBean Registry is now disabled by default, saving approximately 2MB of heap.
If you want to use Tomcat's MBeans, for example so that they can be used to expose metrics via Micrometer, set the `server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled` to `true`.



=== Logback max history
The `<rollingPolicy>` in the default Logback configuration has been updated to use a `<maxHistory>` of 7 days.
It can be tuned using the `logging.file.max-history` configuration property.



=== `HttpHiddenMethodFilter` disabled by default
The filter that handles the `_method` request parameter is now disabled by default as it causes early consumption of a request body if the body may contain parameters.
This can be restored by setting either `spring.webflux.hiddenmethod.filter.enabled` or `spring.mvc.hiddenmethod.filter.enabled` to `true`.



=== Health Indicator
A number of classes have been deprecated to implement the new health indicator groups feature.
If you are configuring a custom `HealthIndicator` via `CompositeHealthIndicatorConfiguration`, you'll need to update it to use `CompositeHealthContributorConfiguration` instead.



=== Micrometer 'New Relic' eventType
Micrometer 1.3 has https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/pull/1588[changed the eventType] that gets published with each metric to be a fixed value.
This aligns with New Relic https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/insights-default-data-other-new-relic-products[best practices].

Spring Boot 2.2 will use the value of `management.metrics.export.newrelic.event-type` as the `eventType` and add "metricName" and "metricType" attributes for context.
If you don't explicitly set an event type property then `SpringBootSample` is used.

If you prefer to use the previous behavor where the meter name was used as the `eventType`, you can set the `management.metrics.export.newrelic.meter-name-event-type-enabled` property to `true`.



=== Health Endpoint JSON
The `/actuator/health` endpoint has changed the resulting JSON format by renaming `details` to `components` for the first-level elements.
This helps to differentiate the actual details returned by a `HealthIndicator` from the component indicators that make up composite health.

As a result of the change, the actuator media type has been bumped from `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json` to `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v3+json`.
If you have tools that need to consume the older format, you can use an HTTP `Accept:` header with the V2 media type, `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json`.



=== DevTools config directory
The preferred location for global DevTools settings is now `~/.config/spring-boot`.
Any of the following files can be used:

- `spring-boot-devtools.properties`
- `spring-boot-devtools.yaml`
- `spring-boot-devtools.yml`

Please see the {docs}/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools-globalsettings[relevant section] of the reference documentation for further details.



=== InMemoryUserDetailsManager

In order to prevent generation and logging of a default password for a Resource Server application, a bean of type `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` is no longer created in the presence of a `JwtDecoder` bean or a `OpaqueTokenIntrospector` bean. If you wish to customize your security configuration such that it requires an `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`, you would need to create the bean yourself.



=== Sample projects renamed and relocated
The sample projects have been renamed to smoke tests to better reflect their intended purpose.
They have also been relocated in the source repository and can now be found https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tests/spring-boot-smoke-tests[here].



== New and Noteworthy
TIP: Check link:Spring-Boot-2.2.0-Configuration-Changelog[the configuration changelog] for a complete overview of the changes in configuration.



=== Java 13 support
Spring Boot 2.2 adds support for Java 13. Java 8 and 11 are also supported.



=== Performance improvements
Startup time and memory usage have been reduced by making use of `proxyBeanMethods=false` in Spring Boot's `@Configuration` classes.
`proxyBeanMethods` is a new attribute on `@Configuration` introduced in Spring Framework 5.2 M1.
`proxyBeanMethods` is also available as an attribute on `@SpringBootApplication` and `@SpringBootConfiguration`.

When launching an application at development time with `bootRun` in Gradle or `spring-boot:run` in Maven, the JVM will be configured with flags (`-Xverify:none` and `-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1`) to optimise it for reduced launch time.
When running on JDK 13 `-Xverify:none` is not specified as it has been deprecated.

Several other performance improvements have also been made in this release:

* Time taken to bind large numbers of configuration properties has been significantly reduced
* As Spring Boot fully prepares a `PersistenceUnit` by scanning JPA entities, Hibernate's own entity scanning has been disabled as it is redundant
* Injection points in auto-configurations have been refined to only apply when a bean has to be created
* Beans related to Actuator endpoints are now only created if the endpoint is both enabled and exposed (via JMX or HTTP)
* Conditions on codec auto-configuration have been improved so that the codecs are no longer configured when they won't be used
* Tomcat's MBean Registry has been disabled by default, reducing Tomcat's memory footprint by approximately 2MB



=== Lazy initialization
It is now possible to enable global lazy initialization to reduce startup time via the `spring.main.lazy-initialization` property.
Please note that using that feature comes at a cost:

* Handling of HTTP requests may take longer while any deferred initialisation occurs
* Failures that would normally occur at startup will now not occur until later

Individual beans can opt out of lazy initialization by annotating their definition with `@Lazy(false)`.
Where it is not possible to use `@Lazy(false)` to opt out of lazy initialization, a `LazyInitializationExcludeFilter` bean can be used instead.
For example, to never set `IntegrationFlow` beans to lazy, you can use the following code:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
static LazyInitializationExcludeFilter integrationLazyInitExcludeFilter() {
    return LazyInitializationExcludeFilter.forBeanTypes(IntegrationFlow.class);
}
----



=== Spring Data Moore
Spring Boot 2.2 ships with Spring Data Moore.
Please see the https://spring.io/blog/2019/10/08/what-s-new-in-spring-data-moore[What's new in Spring Data Moore blog post] to learn more.



=== Shutdown configuration of task execution and scheduling
The behaviour on shutdown for both the auto-configured `TaskExecutor` and `TaskScheduler` is now configurable, see the `spring.task.execution.shutdown` and `spring.task.scheduling.shutdown` namespaces for more details.



=== Kubernetes detection
`ConditionalOnCloudPlatform` now detects if the application is running on Kubernetes.



=== Test Application Arguments in integration tests
`SpringBootTest` allows to specify application arguments that will trigger the creation of an `ApplicationArguments` bean.



=== `@ConfigurationProperties` scanning
Classes annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` can now be found via classpath scanning as an alternative to using `@EnableConfigurationProperties` or `@Component`. Add `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan` to your application to enable scanning.

NOTE: Configuration properties scanning was enabled by default in Spring Boot 2.2.0 but as of Spring Boot 2.2.1 you must opt-in using `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan`.


=== Immutable `@ConfigurationProperties` binding
Configuration properties now support constructor-based binding, which allows a `@ConfigurationProperties`-annotated class to be immutable.
Constructor-based binding can be enabled by annotating a `@ConfigurationProperties` class or one of its constructors with `@ConstructorBinding`.
Annotations such as `@DefaultValue` and `@DateTimeFormat` can now be used on constructor parameters that are provided by configuration property binding.
Please see {docs}spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-constructor-binding[the relevant section] of the reference documentation for further details.



=== RSocket  Support
A new Spring Boot starter has been added in this release, `spring-boot-starter-rsocket`.
This starter brings the required dependencies for building an application that uses RSocket support.
RSocket strategies are auto-configured to provide the required infrastructure for encoding and decoding RSocket payloads using CBOR and JSON.
An `RSocketRequester.Builder` is auto-configured to allow you to create an `RSocketRequester` to send requests to remote RSocket services.
For more on that, check out the {docs}/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-rsocket[relevant section] if the reference documentation.

Auto-configuration for Spring Security's RSocket integration is now available when its `spring-security-rsocket` module is on the classpath.
The auto-configuration will enable RSocket security and configure the server RSocket factory with Spring Security's interceptor.

When testing an RSocket server application, the `local.rsocket.server.port` property is set to the port that the RSocket server is listening on.
It can be injected into test classes using `@LocalRSocketServerPort`.



=== ApplicationContextRunner simple bean registration
The `ApplicationContextRunner` test utility now allows to register bean inline, see `withBean` for more details.



=== `RestTemplateBuilder` request customisation
Methods have been added to `RestTemplateBuilder` to add default headers to all requests and to enable general request customization.



=== Reactive Elasticsearch Auto-configuration
Auto-configuration has been added for the reactive Elasticsearch components introduced in Spring Data Moore.
A `ReactiveElasticSearchTemplate` is auto-configured with the `spring.data.elasticsearch.client.reactive.*` properties.
Auto-configured support for reactive Elasticsearch repositories is also provided.



=== Plain text support for Thread dump endpoint
The `threaddump` actuator endpoint can now return a thread dump in plain text that is compatible with both https://github.com/irockel/tda[Thread Dump Analyzer] and https://fastthread.io.



=== Configurable converters for Actuator endpoint input parameters
Input parameters of an Actuator `@Endpoint` can be managed using custom `@EndpointConverter`-annotated converters.


=== Callback for Redis cache configuration
The `RedisCacheManager` configuration has been improved recently and a `RedisCacheManagerBuilderCustomizer` bean allows you to get a handle to the builder before it is used to configure an immutable `RedisCacheManager`.



=== Qualifier for Spring Batch datasource
In an environment with multiple data sources, a `DataSource` bean can be qualified with `@BatchDataSource` to indicate it is the one to be used by Spring Batch.



=== Build info repeatable output
The build info goal has an extra `time` property that allows to configure how `build.time` is handled.
It can be disabled completely or set to a fixed time to make the output of `build.properties` repeatable.


=== Health indicator for Hazelcast
A `HealthIndicator` is now provided for Hazelcast.


=== Idle JDBC connections metrics
It is now possible to track the total size of a connection pool by tracking the `size` and `idle` metrics.
If you have a custom `DataSourcePoolMetadata` implementation, consider implementing the `getIdle` method.



=== Health indicator groups
It is now possible to organize health indicators into groups.
A typical example if you deploy your application to Kubernetes, you may want one different sets of health indicators for your “liveness” and “readiness” probes.

Groups can be configured via configuration properties.
The following creates a `custom` group with only the `DataSource` indicator:

[source,properties]
----
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.include=db
----

The `custom` group can be invoked by hitting `localhost:8080/actuator/health/custom`.
Check the {docs}/production-ready-features.html#health-groups[updated reference documentation] for more details.



=== Health Endpoint component details
Component details returned from `/actuator/health` can now be configured to be shown independently of the details.
The `management.endpoint.health.show-components` property works in a similar way to `show-details` and can be set to `never`, `when-authorized` or `always`.

For example, if you want to always show the individal health indicators composed to create the system health, but you don't want to show their details you can use:

[source,properties]
----
management.endpoint.health.show-components=always
management.endpoint.health.show-details=never
----

The same property can also be set on a health indicator group.



=== Auto-configuration for Flyway JavaMigrations
Flyway will be auto-configured to use any `JavaMigration` beans that are found in the application context.



=== Sanitization of URI Properties in Actuator Endpoints
The sanitization performed by the `configprops` and `env` endpoints has been improved to include URI properties.
Any password found in the URI's user information will now be sanitized.



=== Banners
ASCII banner files can now make use of ANSI 256 color escape codes by using `{AnsiColor.NNN}` (where NNN is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code[color code]).
You can also use them with image banners by setting the `spring.banner.image.bitdepth` property to `8`.
We've also added a `spring.banner.image.pixelmode` property that you can set to `block` to use ASCII block chars.

The result looks like this:

image::images/animated-ascii-art-256.gif[]



=== SAML Auto-configuration
Auto-configuration for Spring Security's SAML 2.0 Relying Party is now available when its `spring-security-saml2-service-provider` module is on the classpath.
Relying parties can be registered using the `spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.*` properties.

== Deprecations in Spring Boot 2.2

- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* The `logging.file` property has been renamed to `logging.file.name`.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* The `logging.path` property has been renamed to `logging.file.path`.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* The `server.connection-timeout` property has been deprecated in favor of server-specific properties since their behaviors are not strictly the same.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* The `server.use-forward-headers` property has been deprecated in favor of `server.forward-headers-strategy`; previously `server.use-forward-headers=true` would use the web server native support. You can now achieve the same with `server.forward-headers-strategy=native`. Because each server has a specific behavior, we now offer an alternative which relies on Spring's `ForwardedHeaderFilter`: `server.forward-headers-strategy=framework`. Developers should use the option that fits best their use case.
- [big red]*[ x ]* `ReactiveWebServerApplicationContext#getWebServerFactory`.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* The `agent` property of the Maven plugin has been renamed to `agents`.
- [big red]*[ x ]* Joda time support is deprecated in favour of `java.time`.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* `ApplicationHealthIndicator` in favour of `PingHealthIndicator` that is always contributed.
- [big red]*[ x ]* `ConfigurationBeanFactoryMetadata` in favour of `ConfigurationPropertiesBean`.
- [big red]*[ x ]* `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor` constructors in favor of `@EnableConfigurationProperties` or the `register` method.
- [big red]*[ x ]* `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor.VALIDATOR_BEAN_NAME` has moved to `EnableConfigurationProperties.VALIDATOR_BEAN_NAME`.
- [big red]*[ x ]* `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessorRegistrar` in favor of `@EnableConfigurationProperties`.
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* `WebTestClientBuilderCustomizer` has been relocated to `org.springframework.boot.test.web.reactive.server`.

== Legend
- [big Lime]*[ ✓ ]* = Migrated.
