In Spring Security 5, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider via `oauth2Login()` is `ROLE_USER`. This means that the user is allowed to access the application's resources as a regular user.

However, in Spring Security 6, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 provider is `OAUTH2_USER`, and the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OpenID Connect 1.0 provider is `OIDC_USER`. These authorities are more specific and allow for better customization of the user's permissions within the application.
