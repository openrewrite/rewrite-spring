name: org.openrewrite.java.spring.PropertiesToKebabCase
displayName: Normalize Spring properties to kebab-case
description: >-
  Normalize Spring properties to use lowercase and hyphen-separated syntax. 
  For example, changing `spring.main.showBanner` to `spring.main.show-banner`. 
  With [Spring's relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding), 
  `kebab-case` may be used in properties files and still be converted to configuration beans. 
  Note, an exception to this is the case of `@Value`, which is match-sensitive. For example, `@Value("${anExampleValue}")` will not match `an-example-value`. 
  [The Spring reference documentation recommends using `kebab-case` for properties where possible](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding).
